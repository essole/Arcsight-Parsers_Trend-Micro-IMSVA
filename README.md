# Arcsight-Parsers_Trend-Micro-IMSVA

These parsers are Arcsight Flexconnector Regex File type configurations files. The configuration files numbered from 1 to 4 are the files written for extraprocessors. The main configuration file is **trendmicro.sdkrfilereader.properties**. 

For futher undertanding of the configurations that must be done during the installation of the flexconnector, please refer to Arcsight Flexconnector official dev guide document.

Note that about event categorization I also provided the required CSV file located in the directory acp. I recommend replacing this acp directory with the one in the installation directory of your flexconnector just as is.
